                <p style="text-align: justify;">While learning Object-Oriented Programming. I decided to dive into its history and it turned out to be fascinating. The term “Object-Oriented Programming” (OOP) was coined by Alan Kay around 1966 while he was at grad school. The language called Simula was the first programming language with the features of Object-oriented programming. It was developed in 1967 for making simulation programs, in which the most important information was called objects.</p><br>
                <h4 style="color:#25265e;text-decoration: underline;">What Is Object-Oriented Programming? </h4><br>
                <p>Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), is all about creating “objects”. An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions. These variables are often referred to as properties of the object and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects. These objects provide a better and clear structure for the program.<br> <br>For example, a car can be an object. If we consider the car as an object then its properties would be – its color, its model, its price, its brand, etc. And its behavior/function would be acceleration, slowing down, gear change.</p><br>
                <h4 style="color:#25265e;text-decoration: underline;"> 1. What is a Class? </h4><br>
                <p>A class is a collection of objects.  Unlike the primitive data structures, classes are data structures that the user defines. They make the code more manageable.</p><br>
                <p>Let’s see how to define a class below-</p><br>
                <img src="images12/oops/1.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;"><br>
                <p>Here, we use the class keyword to define an empty class PROGGEEK. From class, we construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. </p>
                <h4 style="color:#25265e;text-decoration: underline;"> 1. What is a Object ? </h4><br>
                <p>An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.</p><br>
                <img src="images12/oops/2.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;"><br>
                <p>Here, obj is an object of class PROGGEEK.<br>Suppose we have details of PROGGEEK. Now, we are going to show how to build the class and objects of PROGGEEK.</p>
                    <h4 style="color:#25265e;text-decoration: underline;"> Example 1: Creating Class and Object in Python </h4><br>
                    <img src="images12/oops/3.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;"><br>
                    <p>It will give the following output</p><br>
                    <img src="images12/oops/4.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;"><br>
                    <h4 style="color:#25265e;text-decoration: underline;"> 1. What is a Methods ? </h4><br>
                    <p>Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object.</p><br>
                    <h4 style="color:#25265e;text-decoration: underline;"> Example 2:  Creating Methods in Python </h4><br>
                    <img src="images12/oops/5.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;"><br>
                    <p>It will give the following output</p><br>

                    <h4 style="color:#25265e;font-size: 19px;"> Inheritance</h4><br>
                    <p>Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class).</p><br>

                    <h4 style="color:#25265e;font-size: 19px;"> Polymorphism</h4><br>
                    <p>Polymorphism is based on the greek words poly(many) and morphism(forms).we will create a structure that can take or use many forms of objects.</p><br>
                    <span>Example for Polymorphism :</span><br>
                    <img src="images12/oops/10.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;"><br>
                    <p>It will give the following output</p><br>
                    <img src="images12/oops/11.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;"><br>
                    <h4 style="color:#3c3d5f;font-size: 16px;"> Method Overloading </h4><br>
                    <p>Python does not supports method overloading.We may overload the method but can only use the latest define method.</p><br>
                    <img src="images12/oops/12.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 10px;"><br>
                    <h4 style="color:#3c3d5f;font-size: 16px;"> Method Overriding </h4><br>
                    <p>You can always override your parent class methods.One reason for overriding parent's methods is that you may special or different functionality in your subclass.</p><br>
