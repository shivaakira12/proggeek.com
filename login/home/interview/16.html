			<h3>Do’s & Don’ts</h3><br>
			<p>Enlisted below are the various Do’s and Dont’s in GD.</p><br>
			<p><b>#1) Keep Eye Contact while Speaking:</b> Do not look at the evaluators only. Keep eye contact with all team members while speaking.</p><br>
			<p><b>#2) Initiate the GD</b>: Initiating the GD is a big plus. But keep in mind – Initiate the discussion only when you understand the GD topic clearly and have some knowledge on the topic. Speaking without proper subject knowledge will leave a bad impression.</p><br>
			<p><b>#3) Allow others to Speak:</b>Do not interrupt anyone in-between while speaking. Even if you don’t agree with his/her thoughts, do not snatch their chance to speak. Instead, make some notes and clear the points when it’s your turn.</p><br>
			<p><b>#4) Speak Clearly:</b> Speak politely and clearly. Use simple and understandable words while speaking. Don’t be too aggressive if you are disagreeing with someone. Express your feelings calmly and politely.</p><br>
			<p><b>#5) Make sure to Bring the Discussion on Track:</b> If by any means the group is distracted or deviated from the topic or goal then simply take initiative to bring the discussion on track. Make all the group members aware that you all need to come to some conclusion at the end of the discussion. So stick to the topic.</p><br>
			<p><b>#6) Positive Attitude:</b> Be confident. Do not try to dominate anyone. Keep positive body language. Show interest in the discussion.</p><br>
			<p><b>#7) Speak Sensibly:</b> Do not speak just to increase your speaking time. Don’t worry even if you speak less. Your thoughts should be sensible and relevant instead of irrelevant speech.</p><br>
			<p><b>#8 ) Listen Carefully to Others:</b> Speak less and listen more! Pay attention while others are speaking. This will create a coherent discussion and thereby you will get involved in the group positively. You will surely make people agree with you.</p><br>
			<p><b>#9) Need not get into too many details:</b> Some basic subject analysis would be sufficient. No need to mention the exact figures while giving any reference. You have limited time only, so be precise and convey your thoughts in a short and simple language.</p><br>
			<p><b>#10) Formal Dressing:</b> Do not take it casually. No fancy or funny dressing. You should be comfortable while speaking in a group. Positive gestures and body language will make your work easy.</p>
