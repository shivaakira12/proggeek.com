		<h3>Rules of Group Discussion</h3><br>
		<p>Given below are certain essential pointers that are very important to get noticed and selected in a GD. .</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>#1) Appearance: </b> This is the first thing to be noticed by anyone but still
			people/candidates ignore this aspect of one’s personality. Always wear formal attire and be well-groomed.
		</p><br>
		<p><b>#2) Eye Contact : </b>Your confidence will be seen in your eyes. Hence maintain eye contact with the
			evaluator while initiating the discussion. Later, share eye contact with your peers in a consistent manner.
			During the session, avoid looking at the evaluator and concentrate on the peers.</p><br>
		<p><b>#3) Avoid Dominance :</b>Always remember that it is a discussion and not a battle.

			In the heat of the moment, never lose control of speech and decency. You are there to share your point of
			view and not to start an argument. Respect other’s view and do not try to dominate your views or points.
			Being patient and calm is the key.</p><br>
		<p><b>#4) Avoid Interrupting: </b>It is considered mannerless to interrupt someone while talking. Everyone has a say
			and one should respect and let your turn come for you to have your say. There could be a situation where you
			may need to cut short the speaker, in such cases do it politely with due respect and apologize for doing so.

		</p><br>
		<p><b>#5)Clarity of Speech and Thoughts :</b>Always maintain a medium speed and volume of your
			voice. Be prepared in the mind of your thoughts that you are about to present and be clear. Avoid fumbling
			and jumbling with your speech. Be confident and pardon if you make a mistake while speaking.</p><br>
		<p><b>#6) Irrelevant Talk: </b> Avoid deviating from the main topic and be on the same track. Quality is more
			important than quantity. Be short and simple and refrain yourself from being involved in irrelevant talks..
